# JFT - Just For Testing

## DISCLAIMER

The idea of having a "Kanku Hub" is quite old, but this project is quite new.

ATM we are testing ideas and 
try to find the most comfortable, useful and secure way to implement it.

**Please dont start crying if things change faster than you expected.**

**NOTE: Kankufiles in JFT might not be signed correctly or might not work at all.**
